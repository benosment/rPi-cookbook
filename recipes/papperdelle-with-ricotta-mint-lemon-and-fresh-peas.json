	"Boil your pasta in salted water.",

	"Make the garlic sauce: Saute the garlic in a small pan with the olive oil until it turns a light golden color and becomes aromatic. Remove the pan from heat, swirl it a few times to be sure the garlic is not sticking to the bottom of the pan. Pour the olive oil and garlic into a medium bowl. Add one teaspoon salt.",
	"Drain the pasta and toss it with the garlic-olive oil mixture. Add the peas (optional). Lay the pasta out on a platter, top with spoonfuls of the ricotta mixture and freshly grated parmesan cheese."
